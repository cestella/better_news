How Much Did the Auto Bailout Cost Taxpayers?
June 03, 2011 12:00 PM
ABC News’ Devin Dwyer reports:  President Obama today will again herald the recovery of the U.S. auto industry and the success of the $80 billion financial bailout his administration sponsored for GM and Chrysler.  
“If any of the Republicans running for president now had been president in 2009, auto workers wouldn’t be on the assembly line today, they’d be on the unemployment line,” White House communications director Dan Pfeiffer said this morning on MSNBC. 
But saving the auto companies from bankruptcy, and preserving thousands of American jobs , has cost taxpayers at least $14 billion, according to several estimates by government agencies and independent groups. 
To put it in perspective, $14 billion is double the annual budget of the Transportation Security Administration, or roughly two months of operating expenses for the U.S. military in Afghanistan, based on 2010 figures. 
The Treasury Department announced Thursday that it sold its stake in Chrysler, which is owned by Italian automaker Fiat, resulting in a $1.3 billion loss. 
“As Treasury exits its investment in Chrysler, it’s clear that President Obama’s decision to stand behind and restructure this company was the right one,” Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner said, citing the company’s rebound.
The government has yet to recoup roughly $27 billion from GM, although it holds 500 million shares in the company’s stock.  The value of that stock when the government sells it will determine just how much taxpayers stand to lose. 
At its current price, the stock is work roughly $15 billion, meaning a potential $12 billion loss.  But  don’t expect the price to jump anytime soon, experts say, despite the new profitability of the business. 
“The primary reason the stock isn’t doing well because the market knows the shareholder –- Treasury -– wants to dump 500 million shares,” CATO Institute analyst Dan Ikenson said. “No one wants to buy the stock knowing that there’s going to be this huge sale. So, it’s suppressing the price.”
When will the government cash out? 
Ron Bloom, assistant to the president for manufacturing policy, told ABC News’ Jake Tapper earlier this week there’s no set price to trigger a sell, and that the government will cut ties “as soon as possible” and “as soon as practical.” 
“There is no joy in … recognizing that all of this money will not be returned,” Bloom said. “ On the other hand, as we record what was lost, we need to also record what was saved.  External experts have stated that over a million jobs were saved by the president's actions, and other people have numbers substantially higher than that.”
Ikenson said he expects the administration will want to fully divest of the GM before the 2012 campaign, meaning the ballpark headline cost of the bailout to taxpayers should remain around $14 billion, for now. 
“They didn’t bail out the auto industry, they bailed out two companies,” Ikenson said. “They denied Ford the spoils of competition, and I think they injected a sense of entitlement: If things go bad at Ford, they sort of ‘banked’ their bailout. They didn’t get a bailout this time, but they’ve got a pretty strong argument if they run into financial trouble in the future.  So there could be lingering costs out there.”

Hey, don't knock the President for all his gaffes......look at windmills, for example. While he gets a campaign full of them, he fails to note that China is the leading manufacturer of these "green" machines.  If Obama did his job, and knock off his futlltime campaigning, maybe we could get some work done in the Oval Office.

"In fact, in percentage terms, house prices have fallen further than they did during the Great Depression (as of 1Q11)." Chuck, based on percentage, you are correct. However, one of the main causes of this recession was the over inflated prices of homes during the past couple of decades. The homes before the Great Depression were not inflated. Therefore, you are comparing percent drop in real values versus the percent drop from inflated prices that were not realistic.

POSTED BY: CHUCK | JUN 5, 2011 4:48:29 PM -- You are correct when you said " . . . are not typically leading indicators of a recovery." They are not Leading Indicators of a Recovery because most of the things you listed are usually the last things to turn around in a recovery. I am stating economic facts. You are cherry picking the worse parts of this economy and saying that is the definition of recession, recovery or whatever your point was. You cannot redefine these economic terms to suit your political views.

Rising unemployment, record long-term unemployment, record poverty, record foreclosures, record bankruptcies, and a housing market in worse shape than it was two years ago are not typically leading indicators of a recovery. In fact, in percentage terms, house prices have fallen further than they did during the Great Depression (as of 1Q11).

Rick – great fiction “people lost their jobs in bush last year due to obama saying we are in a depression which took down the market and people lost their jobs.”  Do you really think Obama had enough influence on American businesses to cause the recession under Bush if during the entire campaign Obama haters and republicans were saying he was not born in the US, he is not a Christian, he hates the US, and his friends are terrorists. If you really think that is logical, then you have to blame the slow recovery on the republicans for constantly telling the public that Obama’s plans will not work and the economy is still very weak and may go into a double dip.

We are not in an economic recession and we are not in an economic depression.  The democrats did not control Congress 2007-2008. The democrats and republicans were split evenly in the Senate and therefore it was controlled by a small group of republicans, democrats, and independents that determined whether a bill passed or not. The only bills that became law in those two years were the ones Bush approved because there was not a 2/3 majority to override his veto. These are all facts.  You can say the economy is not recovering fast enough and too many people are still unemployed, but don’t say things that are the opposite of the facts. I have greater respect of both Bush and Obama than I do for any Congress.  I would like the 50 most powerful members of Congress of both parties were voted out, then maybe the remaining members will think twice about doing what’s best for their party rather than what is best for the country.

longT..the rest of the shares will be sold to Fiat and  the rest will be returned .. that will end it. I really don't care if we lost some money because this saved American jobs and this is what it was suppose to. Tell those people in Ohio that it was a mistake..they are working and can feed their famiies and educate them once again. I would rather this than giving it to the banks which have done nothing to help the economy. Obama's saving the auto industry saved millions of jobs and that means people will spend and that helps the economy. When we address the debt we need to cut wasteful spending and also spend...using the money wisely as Obama did. Jobs are what we need and if the reps would cooperate on ifrastructure which they were for before he wanted to do it..it would also benefit this country. They would rather hurt the economy than work with this president.They think they are going to swoop down and save this county if they get in.Well if what we see happening in Ohio,Wisconsin,Florida,
Michigan and New Jersey are examples of what they plan to do....forget it...

IF WE ARE BROKE WE ARE BROKE FOR THE POOR AND THE RICH.IT SEEMS THE SAME PEOPLE GET RICHER AND OTHERS GET POORER...THIS IS NOT FAIR OR JUST.  wHEN SCOTT WALKER WAS ASKED BY SEN.KUCHINICH HOW MUCH MONEY DID HE SAVE BY KILLING UNION RIGHTS...AFTER MUCH DELAY HE  SAID "NOTHING."

"Meanwhile the Republicans smugly offer them austerity measures to help. I wonder if they'll vote for that."
Posted by: Skip | Jun 4, 2011 3:45:46 PM
Nobody likes austerity, Skip, but they understand it's sometimes necessary. In my state, people want big spending cuts and they're frustrated progress is slow. Cutting expenses can be painful, but there can be big long-term benefits.
Austerity is often how people become totally debt-free at a very young age. The people I know running debt-free businesses (and several months of expenses saved) have done much better during Obama's depression than the ones drowning in debt. Not exactly rocket science.
This is not a Republican issue. It's a fiscal issue. The governors of California, Massachusetts, and New York are already on the record discussing upcoming austerity measures, some of them severe. They're all Democrats. Feel free to criticize them.

talmag: "We will be seeing more unemployed as the rep. governors of Wisconsin and Michigan and Ohio are gradually laying off more teachers, firemen and general public jobs....that is not what we need now...we need to keep their jobs."
That's nice and all but there's no money tree. Taxpayers in the private sector PAY for those public jobs and they've said NO to higher taxes. The governors are mandated by law to balance their budgets, and public sector labor is the highest expense. Guess what gets cut? Many states spent way beyond their means. You're seeing the fallout of progressivism run amok.
In Ohio, Medicaid spending has exploded and is now over 40% of the state budget! A very small number of people consume 25% of that spending. Public sector jobs can be saved, but only if Medicaid gets cut severely. Something has to give.
talmag: "we need jobs and not laying off more people....the reps. know what they are doing...they are hoping to make Obama look weak...but most of us who read and do not listen to Fox know just where the problem lies and it is not with Obama."
Nobody has to make Obama look weak. He's doing a great job of doing that on his own. What did people expect? He never had a successful record as a leader before becoming President.
If you want more jobs, instead of crying out for the government to help save us, create a new business and pay your workers living wages. That's what I did.
As for Fox News, you never watch, so how would you know what they say? EVERY major news source is reporting bad economic news, including the federal government's own departments!
We warned the Kool-Aid drinkers repeatedly about Obama. They should have listened.

This was and always be a good investment. Anytime you save American jobs..it is worth the cost...rather than put it toward war.  These workers are finally earning money and making a life for their families and are not on the unemployment line. That is worth much more..and in addition...they are spending which will help the economy also.  I watched the Pres. speech and it was uplifting and hopeful rather than the gloom and doom of others. Yes we have deficit to watch but what you fail to realize is that under Bush the deficit doubled and under Reagen it tripled. This bail out saved over a million jobs and some others say more. Anytime we can save a job for an American worker and not ship them overseas....we have done a great job. Ask those workers...each and everyone who came up to Obama thanked him for saving their job. We forget...inorder to get out of a recession we must close the debt but just as important it we need to invest. We need both things to make this recovery happen and to concentrate solely on the debt as the republicans want is just wrong. We will be seeing more unemployed as the rep. governors of Wisconsin and Michigan and Ohio are gradually laying off more teachers, firemen and general public jobs....that is not what we need now...we need to keep their jobs. That kind of savings is false savings....especially when they give millions more to corporations who were suppose to be the ones hiring...do you see any hirings...I don't. This is money that will never come back into the economy....we need jobs and not laying off more people....the reps. know what they are doing...they are hoping to make Obama look weak...but most of us who read and do not listen to Fox know just where the problem lies and it is not with Obama.

Posted by: MikeMo1947 | Jun 3, 2011 4:51:59 PM
Interesting. Maybe if you keep repeating that mantra, it'll come true.
From The Independent (6/1/11):
"The ailing US housing market passed a grim milestone in the first quarter of this year, posting a further deterioration that means the fall in house prices is now greater than that suffered during the Great Depression.
The brief recovery in prices in 2009, spurred by government aid to first-time buyers, has now been entirely snuffed out, and the average American home now costs 33 per cent less than it did at the peak of the housing bubble in 2007. The peak-to-trough fall in house prices in the 1930s Depression was 31 per cent – and prices took 19 years to recover after that downturn."
---
So our housing market is now in worse shape than it was during the Great Depression. Think about that.
This new milestone once again underscores the epic failure Obama's policies. Thank goodness Gallup says he's popular. That'll be a major comfort to the increasing number of jobless and homeless trying to survive Obama's "non-recession." Hope and Change!

Why are we giving aid to China, Mexico, etc when they are buying our debt? The government couldn't run a snow cone stand and some want them to run our healthcare, education, energy, etc. Close all this money sucking departments and turn it over to the private sector.

For those complaining that unemployment when up a tenth of a percent this month, keep this in mind. In the last 12 months of Bush's Presidency, unemployment went UP 3.0 percent. The last twelve months of Obama's Presidency, unemployment has gone DOWN 0.5 percent.
Posted by: MikeMo10947 | Jun 4, 2011 12:13:09 AM
When Bush took office, unemployment was 4.2%.  In January 2007, unemployment was 4.6%.  THEN Dems took control of the House and Sentate.  By year, unemployment has risen since.
Posted by: wheresmymoney | Jun 4, 2011 10:27:34 AM
Rick, People seem to have short memories.  That is basically how he won the election.  Mocking McCain when he said basically the country is in good shape and continually running down Wall Street.  When people stopped investing, companies went under and unemployment started growing. Look where we are now.

Why didnt the déficit improve since alot of the money is paid backback also people lost their jobs in bush last year due to obama saying we are in a depression which took down the market and people lost their jobs
Posted by: rick | Jun 4, 2011 7:32:37 AM
I wish people would tell the truth. The original "Bank Bailout" was called TARP and was 700 Billion but Bush only gave out 350 Billion to AIG and a small number of the biggest banks. AIG still needs to pay the money it got back but the banks all payed the money back with interest. Obama took the other 350 Billion and gave 150 Billion of it to some of the smaller banks. Not sure if they have paid the money back yet. So the Bail out of the biggest banks made money.

Both parties have had control of the presidency and congress in the past four decades. Neither party has made significant progress on illegal immigration and illegal drugs in our country. Neither party has made any progress in the skyrocketing cost of medical care. Both parties claim that social security is in trouble in a few years, but despite that the extra funds paid into social security is spent by both parties on other things. Neither party has made progress with North Korea, Iran, or the middle east. The deficit increases every year despite which party controls our government. Both parties cater to the rich and powerful. Both parties puts the need of the party to get reelected above the needs of the country. Both parties get reelected by using huge sums of money to distort the truth and make promises they almost never keep. So why do some people put so much more faith in only the republicans or in only the democrats? Neither should be trusted and both should be blamed. Until we hold both parties accountable for not resolving our nation's problems, they will continue to play their game of blaming it on the other party.

January 2009: Chrysler financial receives $1.5 billion from the Treasury Department
May 2009: Chrysler receives a $1.9 billion debtor in possession loan from the Treasury Department
June 2009: Chrysler receives a $6.6 billion loan from the Treasury Department
Total loaned to Chrysler: $14 billion
Chrysler made the following payments to the federal government:
May 2010: Chrysler pays the Treasury Department $1.9 billion to settle their January 2009 loan.
May 2011: Chrysler pays the Treasury Department $5.1 billion as partial settlement for June 2009 loan.
June 2011: Chrysler pays the Treasury Department $560 million to settle the rest of the June 2009 loan.
Total paid back by Chrysler: $7.56 billion
Total loss to taxpayers ($14 billion – $7.56 billion) = $6.44 billion.
