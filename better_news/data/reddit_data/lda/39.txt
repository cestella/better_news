When failure of a pernicious and pervasive type follows you, you check your assumptions.
The paradox of civilization is this: the more successful a civilization, the more it protects and subsidizes the idiots who will destroy it.
It would be a major accomplishment if mankind were to combine a controlled technology with the preservation of Earth. Not only a major accomplishment but a miracle. There are too many humans and everywhere we go to seek peace and tranquility, a hundred others have gone there, too. There was a time when even scientists spoke of the "wonder and glory" of the universe, but we have reverted completely to a mechanistic view, relying on technology to solve every problem which, ironically, it has created in the first place. Can there still be stretches of open land natural wonder alongside hot water and refrigeration? Orion
Here is what you are trained to say: "No, there's no way the two can coexist."
The implication of that is, of course, "let's just keep doing what we're doing, because there's no hope we can change."

Intelligent people tend to breed less. If they keep the less-intelligent people in check, those don't breed recklessly.
But give those people the vote... well, to them money is magic, and power is magic, and it should all be free. So there can be more of them, of course.
The pile of humans bubbles upward, grows huge...
We can't say no to anyone, because we'd be crushing their hopes and dreams.
In the process we polluted everything, destroy innocence, remove beauty, and make clustered, crowded, filthy, dog-eat-dog cities.
And then we have destroyed our dreams.
