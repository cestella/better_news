Oliver Darcy is doing his part to expose liberal ideas and hypocrisy on college campuses. Last month he produced two videos showing students willing to redistribute wealth but not grades and also refusing to pay their share of the national debt. Now he (along with his colleagues Michael Fincher and Maurice Lewis) is back, and this time he’s showing how college students who say they support free speech are willing to sign a petition to “ban” Glenn Beck, Rush Limbaugh, and other conservatives from the airwaves.
In the video, the students are not only willing to sign the petition, but some even offer their thoughts on Beck and those like him.
“That guy’s a douchebag,” one guy says of Beck. “He’s an a**.”
“I hate them bastards,” another man says, even after telling the petition author that in America Beck and others should have a right to say what they want. He signs the petition anyway.
Watch Darcy’s latest video below:
The group’s website, Exposingleftists.com, explains :
Today, many want to limit the speech of those they disagree with,  primarily conservative republicans.  In 1949, the Fairness Doctrine was  introduced under the FCC.  Under Reagan, in 1987, the FCC ended the  doctrine.  While Democrat-controlled congresses have tried to make it  law again, Republicans and those who support free speech oppose their  efforts to reinstate the Fairness Doctrine.   To begin the limitation of  political speech and dissent would lead us to a downward spiral of  freedoms.  As the last bastion of freedom in the world, we must fight to  retain our most important right, and failure is not an option.
