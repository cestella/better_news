LAKE JACKSON, Texas--( EON: Enhanced Online News )--Ron Paul, a twelve-term U.S. congressman, member of the House Foreign        Affairs Committee, and 2012 Republican Presidential Candidate, remarked        on President Obama’s speech earlier today about the United States’        Middle East policy. Please see the statement below.
“Our military’s purpose is to defend our country, not to police the        Middle East.”
“The President gave a speech today about our foreign policy in the        Middle East, and once again this administration has proven that it does        not understand a proper foreign policy for America. When will our        leaders finally do what’s right for America and rethink this irrational        approach we’ve followed for far too long?
“Israel is our close friend. While President Obama’s demand that Israel        make hard concessions in her border conflicts may very well be in her        long-term interest, only Israel can make that determination on her own,        without pressure from the United States or coercion by the United        Nations.
“Unlike this President, I do not believe it is our place to dictate how        Israel runs her affairs. There can only be peace in the region if those        sides work out their differences among one another. We should respect        Israel’s sovereignty and not try to dictate her policy from Washington.
“The President also defended his unconstitutional intervention in Libya,        authorized not by the United States Congress but by the United Nations,        and announced new plans to pressure Syria and force the leader of that        country to step down.
“Our military is already dangerously extended, and this administration        wants to expand our involvement. When will our bombing in Libya end? Is        President Obama seriously considering military action against Syria? We        are facing $2 trillion dollar deficits, and the American taxpayer cannot        afford any of it.
“Our military’s purpose is to defend our country, not to police the        Middle East.
“As the President prepares to send even more support to Egypt, we should        be reminded that it was our foreign aid that helped Mubarak retain power        to repress his people in the first place. Now we have to deal with the        consequences of those decisions, yet we keep repeating the same mistakes.
“I am not the only one who can see the absurdities of our foreign        policy. We give $3 billion to Israel and $12 billion to her enemies.        Most Americans know that makes no sense.
“We need to come to our senses, trade with our friends in the Middle        East (both Arab and Israeli), clean up our own economic mess so we set a        good example, and allow them to work out their own conflicts.”
