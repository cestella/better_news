Earlier today, we covered Ed Schultz’s shocking statement that Laura Ingraham is a “right-wing slut.” As a result of his comments, MSNBC has suspended Schultz for one week without pay. TPM has more :
Schultz will “address” the statement on his 10 p.m. MSNBC primetime show Wednesday, the network said.
NBC News/MSNBC released the following statement earlier this evening:
MSNBC management met with Ed Schultz this afternoon and accepted his offer to take one week of unpaid leave for the remarks he made yesterday on his radio program. Ed will address these remarks on his show tonight, and immediately following begin his leave. Remarks of this nature are unacceptable and will not be tolerated.
