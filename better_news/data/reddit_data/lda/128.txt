I ain’t asking nobody for nothing…
“I ain’t askin nobody for nothin’ – if I can’t get it on my own”
Gee, what a radical thought in Obama’s America. If only more people had the same attitude as the legendary Mr. Charlie Daniels!
People say I’m no-good,
Crazy as a loon.
I get up in the morning,
I get down in the afternoon.
Kinda like my old blue tick hound,
I like to lay around in the shade,
An’, I ain’t got no money,
But I damn sure got it made.
‘Cos I ain’t askin’ nobody for nothin’,
If I can’t get it on my own.
If you don’t like the way I’m livin’,
You just leave this long-haired country boy alone.
Preacher man talkin’ on the TV,
Puttin’ down the rock ‘n’ roll.
Wants me to send a donation,’Cos he’s worried about my soul.
He said: “Jesus walked on the water,”And I know that is true,
But sometimes I think that preacher man,
Would like to do a little walkin’, too.
But I ain’t askin’ nobody for nothin’,
If I can’t get it on my own.
If You don’t like the way I’m livin’,
You just leave this long-haired country boy alone.
A poor girl wants to marry, And a rich girl wants to flirt.
A rich man goes to college, And a poor man goes to work.
A drunkard wants another drink of wine, And a politician wants a vote.
I don’t want much of nothin’ at all, But I will tell another joke.
But I ain’t askin’ nobody for nothin’,If I can’t get it on my own.
If you don’t like the way I’m livin’,
You just leave this long-haired country boy alone..
