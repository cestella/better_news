'gillis,
So DWS should address that issue instead of ignoring it and appealing to the denial of coverage concerns. But again, what good is coverage if you place contradictory requirements and restraints on Medicare and Medicaid providers? The system as it is operates on the basis of cost shifting to private plans. When you have no place to shift costs to and/or the doc fix isn't enough...providers will bail. I have personally bumped up against these issues in terms of acquiring care for my parents and having met doctors who went into consulting and publishing because their specialty (Alzheimer's)was almost entirely Medicare patients. Imagine trying to get an appointment at a cancer treatment facility and waiting for them to check on their balance between Medicare and private patients before that is approved. Imagine having a cardiologist say out loud that he is hesitant to put a defibrillator in your father because of "Medicare rationing". Been there, done that. Again..these issues have been going on before they get squeezed by ballooning medicaid rolls from Pelosi/Reid care and increasing boomer Medicare patients.
The more I hear people squeal about Repubs "ending Medicare as we know it", the more I feel people need to get to know medicare in a real sense.
