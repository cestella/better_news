ThinkProgress points out that the storms that ripped across the southeast - killing over 260 300 people - were from states whose congressional delegations oppose legislation aimed at climate change . Awesome, guys. We appreciate it. While many across this region are trying to pick up the pieces and bury loved ones, we’re glad you could take some time out of your day to play politics with these destructive storms.
Please, don’t let our suffering stand in the way of your arrogance.
