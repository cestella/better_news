My quick thoughts on President        Obama’s much-promoted May 10 immigration speech :
Obama nowhere        mentioned the word " unemployment ".
But he is urging not merely the        amnestying of millions of undocumented Democrats , allowing them full access to the American job market ,        but also increasing legal immigration —already at record        levels. 
Simply put, under Obama the        Democratic Party has definitively abandoned the American        working class. Based on his priorities in this speech,        it has now unmistakably become an alliance of ethnic        chauvinists and plutocrats like Michael (" Billionaire Golfers        for Open Borders ")        Bloomberg.
Still, Obama still        felt compelled to disguise his argument in economic        terms.
This is a confession of political        weakness. Obama knows that Americans oppose amnesty and are against more        immigration,
But in fact, among economists the        consensus on immigration has been clear for 20 years,        and was confirmed by the National Academy of Sciences report The New Americans back in 1997. My        paraphrase:
Americans do not benefit, in aggregate, from        immigration. It does increase Gross Domestic Product—but        the bulk of that is captured by the immigrants        themselves, through their wages. Once transfer payments        are factored in, American taxpayers are paying for their own dispossession. However, immigration does cause a transfer of income        within the native-born community—from labor        to the owners of capital, through its impact        on wages. (See Bloomberg ,        above).
Nevertheless, Obama can still get        away with citing his " economic " flim flam—because the truth has been suppressed.
This is an expression of the Treason        Lobby’s cultural power—and a reason you should give to VDARE.com .
The anti-white, anti-American animosity that Obama is        inciting is all too obvious—even in the edited White        House speech transcript.
Put aside the appalling phenomenon        of a U.S. President again praising immigration        law-breakers among his audience, as he did in his Miami-Dade commencement speech.
Look what happened when Obama claimed ,        albeit with stunning disingenuousness, that the Border Fence        has been built:
THE PRESIDENT: The fence is --
AUDIENCE:  Booo!
THE PRESIDENT:  The fence is now basically        complete.
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  Tear it down!"
Obama did not reprove his        audience. These are Reconquistas that the Democrats are        enlisting.
Again, look what happened when the        President claimed, with more stunning disingenuousness, that—
"…We have gone above and beyond what was requested by        the very Republicans who said they supported broader        reform as long as we got serious about enforcement.  All the stuff they asked for, we’ve done.  But even        though we’ve answered these concerns, I’ve got to say I        suspect there are still going to be some who are trying        to move the goal posts on us one more time.
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  They’re racist!"
In Obama’s America, of course, " racism " is essentially illegal —the charge is meant to end debate,        and probably get the utterer charged with a "hate crime".
But again the President did not        reprove his audience—indicating his utter indifference        to sincere        concerns for the American worker . And for the American        nation.
Well, at VDARE.com, we want to move        the goal posts. And we don’t care what names we’re called.
These are the prerequisites that we        regard as fundamental to any renewed immigration debate:
Control the border.         And we include visa overstayers .
Moratorium on legal         immigration—or         what one of our supporters insists we should call "Comprehensive Immigration Reduction".
Attrition through         enforcement—let’s         find out exactly how many illegals will stay here if         they can’t steal jobs and taxpayer-funded subsidies;
And by "subsidies",, we include ending free education for illegals ( overthrow Plyler vs. Doe ) and ending Birthright citizenship.
Make English the official language and prohibit        employers from discriminating against monolingual English-speakers . (cf. Quebec’s language laws in defense of French)
Prohibit immigrants from receiving Affirmative Action quota preferences.        I think Affirmative Action for American blacks is a bad idea , but immigrants weren’t even here to be discriminated        against in the first place.
You won’t hear these prerequisites        discussed anywhere else.
