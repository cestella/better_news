NASA... You Used To Be Cool
Of all the Government agencies out there, NASA's one you could almost, kind of... like. Remember the days when convertible driving test pilots were the only ones crazy enough to be "astronauts"? It felt like NASA was different, like they weren't bullshitting you or trying to fuck you over. Sure, the Government probably shouldn't be forcing you to pay for other people's trips to space... but Goddamnit, that doesn't mean it wasn't the greatest fucking thing in the world.
You might think that any Government agency that had garnered that kind of goodwill (from even libertarians) would be careful not to fuck up their image, but no. Now the people who brought you "One small step for man, one giant leap for mankind" have gone from representing the pinnacle of human advancement, to shit-talking humanity to children (from a NASA website):
First of all, Government interference in the free market (through biofuel mandates and subsidies) have been the driving force behind Amazon deforestation for years . The artificial price incentivizes people to cut down forests and grow those crops. So this video teaching kids that we need to do more to stop global warming, uses as its evidence, the disastrous fucking consequences of doing more to stop global warming. Goddammit NASA, not very scientific.
Also... hey NASA, polar bears can't fucking talk, neither can monkeys. They're fucking violent, wild animals that would kill you if they had a chance. The fact that humans give two shits whether they die at all reflects the compassion and greatness of human beings. But how do those fucking bastards repay your kindness?
So people willingly pay higher prices and reduce their standard of living for the remote possibility of saving the lives of thoughtless monsters that would gladly murder and eat your whole family... And we're still the assholes? God fucking dammit NASAÉ Get your shit together.
