The IMF is as crooked and devious as is the UN both of these dirtbag outfits major funders is, yes you guessed the good Ol' USA a sucker for graft and larceny if there ever was one.  The IMF is just another way of making eropeans millionaires with no wrk involved and then allow them to give the taz payers monies away to the undeserving.  The earth has 179 countries that are known of this 152 recieve US foreign aid from the USA to the tune of $400 billion/yr. and every year this foreign aid amount is a lump sum of monies with not distinguishing as to whether any of thse countrys is deserving of aid, they just keep getting the same amount...........YOUR TAX DOLLARS AT WORK UNDER THE AUSPICES OF GOVERNMENT OVERSIGHT.

Give 'til it hurts and then give some more. That's our government's motto when it comes to foreign countries. Where does it stop? America simply cannot afford this any longer. We are going broke and the only cuts our government is willing to make are cuts that take away from our own people. It's time we cut out all the foreign 'aid'. For the most part all this 'aid' we send overseas goes right into the pockets of the crooked officials in those countries. NOT to the people in need. This country is nothing more than a doormat for the rest of the world to wipe it's feet on! And I for one am sick and tired ot it.

Before I start crying at the continuous stupidity of the American govt., esp. the fact that it cares more for other countries' citizens than it does for its own, I ask the question: Wouldn't it make sense to wait to see who is in charge of these govts., BEFORE we (or our idiot president) promises money ? Any money the US gives to a Muslim nation is money spent for our own self-destruction. Every penny spent in foreign aid should be audited by an American accounting firm. If we don't have the money to spend on Americans, where will we get it to spend on foreigners ? Every one of the G-8 countries is in financial distress. I say, let the oil-rich Arab Muslim countries contribute to the fund; they've got the money - we haven't. I keep asking my Rep. senator where Obama gets his authority as he runs around the world giving out American taxpayers' money to promise money we don't have.

It's unconstitutional to give tax payers money to foreign countries.  We NEED to stop this madness before it completely destroys every one of us (except the elites of course who have money in foreign countries._

I just read where the U.S. government won't have enough money to help the tornado victims here in our own country so we can borrow money to "help" rich countries like Saudi Arabia but can't help our own tax paying citizens who are funding our government's wasteful spending?

All I want to know is just where the hell is the US supposed to come up with 2 Billion dollars. We have enough trouble with OBUMA spending us into oblivion without adding another 1,2,3 or more BILLION dollars to the list.  Use that money here at home to slow the spending lunacy in the US.
