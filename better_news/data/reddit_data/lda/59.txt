Barton was agreeing to Stewart’s general point about allowing mosques and community schools to practice their religion, and Stewart threw that bit about sharia in there very fast, as a run-on clause, spoken at lower volume (running out of breath and hurrying to his next point) at the end of his main sentence, at which point Barton was primed to get to his chance to speak.
Barton said “yes” to the whole bungle, to throw it aside so he could try to make a point. But the speed of the conversation, and Stewart’s ability as host to direct, divert, and interrupt, did not allow Barton time to clarify or revisit.
He certainly did not bring up sharia himself.
You’d have to edit that passage hard to make it seem like Barton truly meant to agree with sharia law. Besides, to “call” Barton on it without asking him first to clarify would be inconsistent with seeking the truth. Absent that, it’s reasonable to assume the answer lugina15?s question is a simple, “not intentionally.”
(Folks who refuse to discern freedom of religious practice from sharia, on the basis that Islam does not recognize such a division, are engaging in futility. In Western culture, law is a separate discipline, separate function of society, and maintains a separate infrastructure, vs. religion and religious practice. Religious people may make laws, but the practice of doing so by pointing to religious dictates is one that is no longer followed. So Barton can be correct in speaking of allowing the Muslims to follow their faith, while not–as I imagine he meant–agreeing to their use of sharia where it conflicts with law in the United States.)
