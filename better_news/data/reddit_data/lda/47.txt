I had to put my  newspaper down the other day after reading an article about six brave  soldiers who recently joined the ranks of the “forever young” after an  improvised explosive device went off in Afghanistan May 26, 2011. It’s  been a long ten years.
War is not for the fainthearted, nor is it  for the impatient.  I am guilty on both counts, but believe I am not  alone in my feelings as I come to understand that the cost of war  expands far beyond America’s diminishing treasure; our blood investment  must indeed reap benefits beyond an “an eye for an eye.”  We are better  than that.

With scant media reports about the positive impacts of  our presence in Afghanistan, it’s easy to fall prey to a feeling of  hopelessness regarding our operations there. A cursory glance at  Afghanistan seems to project a dysfunctional nation infested with  godless, faceless, soulless lunatics who will stop at nothing to “kill  all infidels.” This type of generalization makes us worse than our  enemy – because we know better.
It is far too easy to politicize a  war. Those who believe that we should “cut and run,” reveal their own  cowardice and give no thought to the ramifications thereof – the certain  and absolute loss of untold innocent lives. Think: Cambodia Vietnam.  Now is not the time for Tuesday morning water cooler discussions about  what could’ve, should’ve or would’ve been done yesterday.  We are where  we are, and must see things as they are – today. We must also see the  faces of real Afghanis trying to make a difference.
“Skin” in  advertising sells magazines the same way bad news sells newspapers. I  had to search far and wide for good news regarding our military presence  in Afghanistan, and found it at a little known website at www.goodafghannews.com :
• This spring, 32 Afghan students ,  including eight women, made history as the first graduating class of  American University of Afghanistan. Ambassador to Afghanistan, Karl  Eikenberry, gave the keynote speech, and a video message recorded by  former First Lady Laura Bush, well-known for her work to promote  equality and quality of life for Middle East women, was played during  the ceremony.
• New schools and universities are not the only  things to sprout up throughout Afghanistan. New hospitals and airports  are in process as well as the rebuilding of canal systems and wells that  were utterly destroyed during the Soviet invasion in the 1980s. Once  rebuilt, Afghanistan will have the ability to provide food, water,  healthcare and transportation for its people, and boost its economy with  new jobs and exports.
• The beverage industry in Afghanistan is  growing at 30 percent annually and PepsiCo is building a $60 million  plant in Kabul to distribute Pepsi products, which will create 800  additional jobs.
Although it seems that for every step forward,  we take two back, in reality, we are slowly winning Afghani hearts and  minds. The International Council on Security and Development completed a  recent survey of 1400 representatives throughout Afghanistan that found  our military achievements “unquestionable,” with the majority believing  that NATO and the Afghan government are “winning the war.”
Enjoying  a cold Pepsi in Kabul or a woman graduating from college cannot make up  for the loss of a single soldier’s life, but these events remind us,  and the Afghan populace we’re not just there to kill Bin Laden, we’re  there to save a people from the grip of the savages among them who  checked out of humanity a long time ago. And for that, the sacrifice is  not in vain.
Getting lost in the darkness of war has a tendency  to overshadow its purpose, and sometimes we need to be reminded why it  is good to take the next step forward. In his “Lord of the Rings”  trilogy, author J.R.R. Tolkien amply explained “why,” when his  character, Sam, encouraged his buddy Frodo to continue in the fight.  Tolkien wrote, “By rights we shouldn’t even be here. But we are. .it is  only a passing thing, this shadow…a new day will come… there’s some good  in this world…and it’s worth fighting for.”

I check out the website mentioned. I had no idea those people wanted progress.  Amazing. Eight women getting to attend/graduate college.  No wonder the Taliban is outraged.  GO US MILITARY!

Absolutely. In 2001, that country was the safe haven for Al Qaeda and that suppressive regime the Taliban. There is some question now as to whether we should remain or simply keep covert Special Forces units available to call in air strikes or drones. As long as jihad and/or terrorism exists, our mission is not complete.  
I had hoped we would not engage in nation building, but to aid in gaining their confidence and retaining those hearts and minds, it has also been a humanitarian and human rights mission. The price has been very heavy in blood and funding, but we have been winning on both fronts.

All you have to remember is what happened when we cut Afghanistan loose from our support last time.

Do you think Thumper-Brown would remember that there was a “last time”?
She wrote: “Think: Cambodia Vietnam.”
She didn’t write “Afghanistan, the last time,” and then mention the close ties being forged between the Taliban and, say, some good ol’boys down in Texas, the support given to the Taliban when it seemed they were the only ones disciplined and strong enough to unite a “country” “ruled” by various warlords armed with whatever they had when they were the Mujahadin.
Nice little ad for Pepsi, at any rate. But you gotta admit: quoting Tolkien at the end was… really, really weird, even for Fluffy.

I agree. Nation building only works when you have a citizenry sufficiently mature to be able to grasp the concepts you want to implement. Afghanistan is not. It’s one of the most backward, primitive nations on earth held together by Islam. Joe Biden was right. We should be fighting a counter terrorism strategy, not counter insurgency. Afghanistan can’t be saved but Al Qaeda can be stopped.

I guess we will find out soon if barry listens to the experts in the field or does the politically expedient thing and sells out to his base. General Petraeus says troops are still needed in Afghanistan. Push comes to shove barry will cave.

Interesting revisionist history.  I remember a great deal of appropriate concern when the Taliban took over Afghanistan, and I was still in high school.

Progress made possible by USA is over-rated.  It cannot begin to make up for the loss of Afghan life caused by a “liberating” army that often acts as an occupier.  Similar American arrogance in Pakistan already threatens to unhinge the alliance on which we depend for land access to Afghanistan.

Stalin also signed a pact with ole Adolph.

Just a hunch, but I’d bet that 3 billion in aid will insure land access.

“Revisionist”? It was all very sordid. The Taliban came out of the Mujahadin: funding for various Muslims to come from around the world to fight the Soviets in Afghanistan. After that, they were welcome in Afghanistan and Pakistan because they built schools that the states could not afford.
After Afghanistan dissolved into a mass of warring tribes/clans or groups united under any of a number of warlords, the Taliban were picked as the strongest, most disciplined group most likely to bring stability to the country, which was what companies like Unocal needed before they started to build pipelines across. Some Taliban officials even visited Texas in 1997.
Definitely “appropriate concern,” yes.

My favorite part of this article is where the author reminds us of all of the horrible things that happened after we left Vietnam and stopped bombing Cambodia. Oh, but, wait. They are both safe places to visit, and from what I’m told exceedingly beautiful. When the US military left they didn’t become terrorist states or, lo dread, communists. No, the people just stopped dying from the effects of America’s killing forces. And over time they have stopped hating us for what we did to them.
Ten years in Afghanistan and the significant progress that is used as an example is a class of 35 people graduating, and a new market for an American company which manufactures unhealthy, high-calorie food and also just happens to have a huge military contract feeding our troops. A class of 35 could have been educated in a typical conference room, but US taxpayers built a “University”. And Patraeus needs more troops! Of course he does. What manager who is NOT responsible for the bottom line doesn’t want to increase his power with more employees under them.The US armed the Taliban, and now it plays a game pretending to destroy them. It’s all about spending money with no checks and balances, people! It’s time to put an end to it. American corporations and their political cronies are blowing up and building up other nations to create more construction projects and global consumers while dismantling America – all on America’s dime. If you don’t see this yet, I hope you will soon. Time is running thin for the USA.

And Henry Ford wrote Nazi propaganda, and the Duponts helped pay some of Adolf’s campaign expenses. But you forgave them that because they “provided jobs.”
So: Adolf was another one of your “friends,” right? Because he fought one of your enemies (Stalin)?
geoff
Whatever happened to spending cuts and a balanced budget, etc.?
$3 billion in aid? To Pakistan?!?
What are you smoking today? Or have you been borrowing some of Cal’s meds?

A private university with high tuition fees, so only the local elite (friends of Karzai) can afford to send their kids.
But at least they got Pepsi.

As expedient as it is to avoid nation-building under most circumstances, sometimes the alternative is worse, much worse…

“It’s one of the most backward, primitive nations on earth held together by Islam.” It’s not “held together,” and when it was, it was by stronger forces (the British empire, or the Soviets), not Islam.

So did August A. Busch. It was that world domination and superior race thingie that was his downfall. After awhile friends like relatives can become annoying.

70+ of the dems just sided with the GOP to include cuts as a requirement to increasing the debt limit. Goes to that needs vs frivolous wants.

And Prescott Bush continued to trade with them during the war (“trading with the enemy”). And IBM helped schedule train loads of deportees to the death camps.
But that’s all OK because Adolf fought your enemy Stalin, so that makes Adolf your friend, right? Even better, killing all those “future terrorists,” right?

Hell, selling tainted goods and low quality supplies most likely aided our victory. His son and grandsons did very well. As did Augie Busch Jr.

“Blowback,” right? Arm the Mujahadin, and they tend to blow it back in your face.
So: abandon Karzai and he might turn into another Saddam, right?

He did very well, trading to the enemy. And it wasn’t “tainted goods and low quality supplies,” Tommy. Guess again.
“In 1924, his father-in-law, a well-known St Louis investment banker,
helped set him up in business in New York with Averill Harriman, the
wealthy son of railroad magnate E H Harriman in New York, who had gone
into banking.
“One of the first jobs Walker gave Bush was to
manage UBC. Bush was a founding member of the bank and the incorporation
documents, which list him as one of seven directors, show he owned one
share in UBC worth $125.
The bank was set up by Harriman and
Bush’s father-in-law to provide a US bank for the Thyssens, Germany’s
most powerful industrial family.
“August Thyssen, the founder of
the dynasty had been a major contributor to Germany’s first world war
effort and in the 1920s, he and his sons Fritz and Heinrich established a
network of overseas banks and companies so their assets and money could
be whisked offshore if threatened again.
“By the time Fritz
Thyssen inherited the business empire in 1926, Germany’s economic
recovery was faltering. After hearing Adolf Hitler speak, Thyssen became
mesmerised by the young firebrand. He joined the Nazi party in December
1931 and admits backing Hitler in his autobiography, I Paid Hitler,
when the National Socialists were still a radical fringe party. He
stepped in several times to bail out the struggling party: in 1928
Thyssen had bought the Barlow Palace on Briennerstrasse, in Munich,
which Hitler converted into the Brown House, the headquarters of the
Nazi party. The money came from another Thyssen overseas institution,
the Bank voor Handel en Scheepvarrt in Rotterdam.”
