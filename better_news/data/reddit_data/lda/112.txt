Obama's Plan For 2012: Rely on Fraudulent Votes
Ê
By John Anderson
With the plans to grant citizenship to millions of illegal aliens in time for the 2012 election blocked for now by the the voter revolt of 2010, the Obama's Democratic machine now seems to be placing its hopes on fraudulent votes to tip the balance in their favor.
Ê
In a recent column in USA Today, Democratic strategist Donna Brazile attacked attempts by many states to combat voter fraud.  Brazile has managed a number of campaigns for the Democrats, recently served as the interim Chair of the Democratic National Committee, and is an Adjunct Professor of 'Women and Gender Studies' at Georgetown University.  During the 2008 Democratic Primary, she advocated for the disqualification of delegates elected by voters from the states of Florida and Michigan on the basis of these states had set their elections too early, declaring that "we need to send a message that you can't defy the rules."  This makes her a strange messenger to declare that states should back off from trying to enforce rules on voting designed to eliminate fraud.
Ê
Brazile claims that requirements to provide photo identification at the polls is 'costly', citing the $13 per ID cost to the state of Indiana for providing free photo IDs to those who claim they are too poor to pay the $13 themselves.  Brazile neglects to mention that laws requiring the state to provide free photo IDs were put in place precisely to combat claims by liberal activists such as herself that photo ID requirements could 'disenfranchise the poor' (apparently, those too poor to come up with $13 in Indiana or $5 in Iowa ).  Left wing activist groups have brought numerous lawsuits against states passing laws to combat voter fraud, costing states far more money to defend themselves against the lawsuits than the laws cost to enforce.  In 2005, a commission co-chaired by former President Jimmy Carter, on whose campaigns Donna Brazile worked in 1976 and 1980, recommended in 2005 that every eligible voter receive a 'free' government photo ID by 2010.  At the time, Donna Brazile apparently had no objection to this measure which would put an even greater cost burden on governments to provide 'free' photo IDs.
Ê
Brazile claims that a utility bill, government-issued check, or bank statement would be a better way to check for identity at polling places.  However, common sense would indicate that those too poor to cough up $5 for a photo ID would be even less likely to have a bank account, utility bills in their own name, or access to a government check.  If they are receiving a government check, they are certainly able to afford the $5 for a photo ID.
Ê
The key problem with the above listed documents, other than the fact that they generally cost far more financial resources to obtain than a photo ID does, is that there is no way to verify that the bearer of the document actually is the person listed.  Anyone could easily steal the mail of an elderly or disabled person and vote under that person's name.  Additionally, the wide variety of issuers of such documents would make a forged or otherwise fraudulent document almost impossible to detect.
Ê
In previous elections, lack of photo ID requirements has likely swung elections to Democrats based on fraudulent votes.  For example, in 1994, Louisiana passed a law requiring voters to produce a photo ID if they registered by mail and had never voted before in the location where they intended to vote.  However, then-Assistant Attorney General Deval Patrick, who is now Governor of Massachusetts and was a key backer of Barack Obama's Presidential campaign, declared that the photo ID requirement violated the 1965 'Voting Rights Act'.  The Democratic candidate went on to win the election by a margin of 5788 votes, well less than the 7454 votes which were later identified as fraudulent according to a report in Readers' Digest.
Ê
Vote fraud, which could have been stopped by requiring photo IDs, may have been even more pervasive than that.  Matching reports of similar events occurring periodically in other locations, according to participants and witnesses of a 'get out the voter operation' in New Orleans, supporters used vans to haul voters from one precinct to the next. "They'd give them different names," one driver told  investigators. "Each person voted about seven times."  Vote fraud continues in recent elections, for example earlier this year officials in Troy, New York were indicted for forging absentee ballots in a fall 2009 election.
Ê
With other elements of Obama's proposed 'new coalition' of convicted felons , illegal aliens , and noncitizen Somalis stymied for the time being, his operatives appear to be turning to the tried & true 'Chicago method' of voter fraud as their plan to retain power in the 2012 election.  Many of Obama's actual voters from the 2008 election, who voted for him based on disgust with George Bush and John McCain, a desire to elect the first black President, or a genuine desire for 'change' have now defected, as evidenced by the 2010 elections.  Many liberals are disillusioned by actions of the Obama administration such as the attack on Libya, the escalation of the war in Afghanistan, and coziness with large corporations such as General Electric.
Ê
With the expected loss of these voters, Donna Brazile is leading the charge to clear the way for voter fraud with preemptive charges of 'GOP wasting money' to 'block voters' from the polls.  Hopefully not only will their scheme fail, but enough real voters will show up to outvote whatever fraudulent votes they manage to conjure up.
