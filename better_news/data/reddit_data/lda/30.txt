The whistle blower said there were over 2,500 guns involved in the Project Gun Runner case. That number of guns represents less than one percent of the number of guns used by the drug cartels. So... how is it small gun shops are supposedly supplying tens of thousands of AK 47 style guns to the drug cartels? The answer is, they are NOT! Are some guns getting to the cartels from the small shops? It would be foolish to say otherwise. But, they are not the suppliers they are made out to be. Perhaps our government should be looking at the socialist - fascist - Marxist governments of South & Central America about those guns. Maybe they should talk w/ the Chinese &/or many Middle Eastern governments. Perhaps someone may want to talk to the Russians? Its not Americans selling the bulk of those guns, its foreign governments, criminal organizations, & perhaps even some of those holier than thou special interest groups?! Project Gunrunner was supposed to track straw purchased guns in America to the Mexican drug cartels. American shops do not sell fully automatic AK 47 guns. So where are they coming from? The small shops could not possibly keep a supply of or move that amount of inventory w/o it being patently obvious to even the federal government. Someone wanted to create the appearance of gun sales so they could justify serious gun control &/or confiscation laws in America. The system or leftists want our guns. They will say or do whatever they think they must to force such laws through! Now exposed for what they are they stonewall even congress. This is why we need to control the size & power of the federal government. Its out of control & its seeking draconian laws to control, the people. This was an outrageous attempt by government bureaucrats, meaning radical leftists, seeking to take guns from Americans. They hate the 2nd Amendment so they decided to contrive a crime to lay on gun shops & use that to punish average Americans & take away a constitutional right. My how the left hates our constitution. It does not say enough for some. They want it to say more. More accurately, they want it to be a list which bureaucrats can then use to create massive & oppressive new regulations, to control Americans. We really do need to get out & vote come 2012. Or else we may face a government out to make us subjects, rather than individual free citizens of a government we permit to operate!

Again we hear the names of our law enforcement officials either not enforcing the laws or breaking the law, this time caught smuggling illegal weapons to terrorist and then offering up some lame excuse that amounts to elitism and disrespect for both the law and the citizens they are meant to protect.....This behavior by those like Holder and Napolitano are intolerable and they both need to consider resigning if they are not capable of instituting and keeping the law of the land.

ONTIME, Holder and Napolitano resigning ain't gonna cut it. Somebodys a$$ should go to prison for this. If over 2500 guns were straw purchased with the blessing of ATF, then ATF is complicit in at least over 2500 felony acts. I don't think you or I could expect to escape 2500 felony counts with just a "reprimand". Neither should the crook who hatched "Fast and Furious".  It's ironic as hell that ATF helps promote this site: http://www.dontlie.org/FAQ.cfm

remember when the mexican president stood before our congress and said many bad things about the US and the liberals applauded.  one of those things was that americian guns bought from americian stores were adding to the crime in mexico.  SO, this has all the smacking of a liberal attempt to create statistical numbers that prove gun sales in the US foster crime and that 2nd amendment rights need to be abolished.    this is a little more plausible than "golly, we were trying to locate bad guys by selling them guns".  Thank GOD that Holder has nothing to do with nuclear weapons.
