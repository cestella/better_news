Stop "ALL" forms of welfare.  No "subsidies", no foreign aid, NO ONE gets ANYTHING that ANYONE ELSE does not get.  If someone NEEDS help, fine provide for them for 30 days - no more.

I agree stop all forms of welfare - the only way to get to a balanced budget amendment starting in 2012.  Individual welfare recepients must provide some type of labor to receive any payments.  If you are verifiable disabled then some type of assistance would be authorized.

Good comments, I agree.  No subsidies!  No bailouts! No transfers of wealth!  Charity is personal, not governmental.  No government picking winners and losers!  No more promises of something for nothing.  No new government programs, in fact cut most.  Allow people to control their own money invested in Social Security.  Move away from current Medicare model to the choices that Congress has as Ryan proposes for people less than 55 today.  Cut, cut, cut government spending.  Move functions to the states and local communities or let the people do for themselves.       No more spending our children and future generations into poverty.

I believe this is the main reason the Republicans are so reluctant to endorse Sarah.  They don't want their gravy train upset.  She doesn't show favorites when it comes to cutting and demanding accountability, and they don't want that.  And of course the otherside is deathly afraid of her.  But, if we don't find some conservative with the intestinal fortitude of Sarah, we and this nation are in deep kimche!

April 6, 2011  The oil crisis has caused many problems, not the least of which is the high price of gasoline for cars. Ethanol manufactured from corn might go a long way in  helping the economy.  The main consideration would be "Is ethanol safe?" When gasoline is used for driving cars it spews out carbon monoxide which pollutes the air.  Less use of gasoline which creates this hazard would probably bring down the rates of cancer as well as respiratory diseases. I am unaware of whether the safety of ethanol has been tested. It appears to be a safe product, or at least is thought to be environmentally sound.  The second consideration with  ethanol is the use of it might cause the price of corn to be raised.  Those who wish to use corn only as a food are not pleased with the whole idea. They say that there is not enough corn to be used for both fuel and food.  My idea is this, if the government brought back the "Homestead Act," and gave away land to provide homes for those who would then become farmers, they could double the production of corn, provide self-employment for many people who are now  unemployed, and lower the cost of corn, because the  laws of supply and demand would become balanced. Plus, it would lessen the demand for foreign oil, which right now is effecting the economy adversely.   Most people seem to like corn. However, it does not have the same nutritional value as other foods. The American Cancer Society provides a list of foods that are high in nutrition. Those with high anti-oxidants (that prevent cancer)are brocceli, brussel sprouts, tomatoes and  blueberries.  However, people who like corn should be able to get it at a reasonable price. I believe that my idea would work!
