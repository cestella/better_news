Right-to-work laws 'drive down the quality of life'
As a woman of faith, I oppose so-called "right to work" legislation.
The relationship between religion and the labor movement is undeniable. Both communities work to create a world where people are treated fairly and given a chance to succeed.
Historically, religious institutions have supported the right of workers to join together in unions with the goal of attaining fair wages and healthy working conditions for all employees.
As we have seen recently, attacks against workers have been spreading across the nation, from Wisconsin to Maine.
We Mainers pride ourselves on our strong traditional values of hard work and family. We have built this state with rugged hands and nimble fingers, excelling in industries from paper mills to textiles.
Bills such as L.D. 788 and L.D. 309, which directly attack a worker's right to freely organize, jeopardize the way of life we have become accustomed to and would be a step backward in the history of labor and workers rights.
Right-to-work laws will inhibit the ability of management and workers to bargain about issues that will benefit all employees, not only union employees. Right-to-work laws not only drive down the quality of life for all workers, but they also undermine the sense of collective good.
The needs of the individual and the community should always be kept in balance.
During this time of economic and political disrupt, it is important to preserve a sense of unity.
We should protect institutions such as free collective bargaining that promote harmony, collaboration, balance and justice.
