Judge to O'Keefe: You Can't Hide Illegal Activity Behind First Amendment
Remember the very first James O'Keefe videotape dress-up "sting operation"? The one where he and an "associate" tried to smear ACORN with secret taping and deceptive editing--and were only discredited after they'd done serious damage to the organization's reputation? Well the ACORN worker in question filed suit, and this week down came a ruling from a judge that was damning to O'Keefe.
Via  Brad Friedman's BRAD blog :
Rightwing activists and propagandists James O'Keefe and Hannah Giles, employees of  con-artist and propagandist Andrew Breitbart, may not use the First Amendment as an excuse for breaking the law in California, according to a federal judge's ruling this week.
Judge M. James Lorenz rejected the defendants' argument and motion for summary judgment in federal court, as part of the  civil lawsuit filed against them  by former San Diego ACORN worker Juan Carlos Vera. 
Read more about the specifics of the case, and the ruling, and the history of O'Keefe's damaging ACORN smear job, at   Brad Friedman's BRAD blog.
