Wal-Mart's Huge 2010 Sales: $421,849,000,000 And Counting
Wal-Mart raked in the dough last year, earning $421.8 billion in profits-- which is about equivalent to what the US spent on Medicare in 2009. (Quick, someone call Mitch McConnell .) Seems like some priorities are messed up in our culture? Read on :
That $421.8 billion is also about $9 billion less than Taiwan's 2010 gross domestic product -- the total value of the country's goods and services in a single year -- and $7 billion more than Norway's 2010 GDP . In other words, if Walmart were a country, it would be the 25th largest economy in the world.
Speaking of countries, let's talk population: Fortune reports that 2.1 million people work at Walmart , which means there are about as many Walmart employees sprinkled across the globe as there are people living in the African country of Namibia (yes, that Namibia, where Anegelia Jolie gave birth ). There are another 95 countries with populations smaller than the retailer's sprawling workforce, including Botswana, Kosovo, The Gambia, Trinidad and Tobago, Bahrain, Cyprus, Qatar, Luxembourg, Belize, Iceland, The Bahamas and Greenland.
Daily Finance also reports that the amount of land their stores take up -- not including their parking lots -- equals  the size of Manhattan, 1 1/2 times over. Planet Wal-Mart, indeed.
