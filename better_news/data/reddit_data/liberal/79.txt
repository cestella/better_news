Good thing.
Turns out the Senate didn't vote on the Ryan and/or Toomey budgets yesterday -- at least in part because Sen. Paul (R-KY) held the floor for seven hours in an attempt to block PATRIOT Act renewal, and good for him  -- so I can pass along United for a Fair Economy's link to the Coalition on Human Needs' budget alert, plus much more helpful information.  I didn't get very specific about raising revenues yesterday, but UFE does:  apparently, if we bring back a robust Estate Tax, tax capital gains and dividends as actual income, eliminate the Bush Mobb tax-cuts-for-the-wealthy, jack up tax rates on millionaires via the Fairness in Taxation Act, and close corporate overseas tax havens, we can raise over $350 billion in new revenue a year.  Remember $350 billion:  that used to be the deficit, before all those bailouts and stimuli.  And n.b. that the Fairness in Taxation Act only raises top rates to 45%; if we brought back the 91% bracket for millionaires, we'd do even better.  We also didn't mention the revenues we'd raise by closing the "carried interest" loophole that allows hedge fund managers to pay lower taxes than their secretaries.  So here's the new, improved alert .
