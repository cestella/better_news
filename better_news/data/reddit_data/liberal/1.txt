Andrew Breitbart Was Right About Weiner’s Wiener, He’s Still A Troll
Digg Digg
I was very was skeptical about Andrew Brietfarts Wienergate discovery, I mean can you really blame me for having reservations? Of course not, but needless to say the right-winger was right for once , and for that he gets a cookie. Weiner was indeed sending pictures of his wood to countless women over the internet, he was sexting, talking, jerking, whatever.
This still doesn’t change the fact that Breitfart is a human troll who revels in anarchy, or what we call Perez Hilton’s crotch on a Saturday morning.
Like the media whore that he is, Breitfart crashed the Weiner press conference only to say he didn’t. He’s going to parade in front of the media looking for a pat on that back and maybe a thumb up the you know what. It still doesn’t excuse with he did to Shirley Sherrod, which by the way he has never apologized for.
But this is what you get when you’re an egotistical maniac with a questionable sexuality, and probably a low sperm count. Now that I’ve given him his fifteen minutes back to Weiner. Did he break the law? No he did not. The guy is a fucking human being, like all of us we make mistakes, some more drastic than others. Nevertheless we make them, but most importantly we learn from them. Up until now Anthony was a hell of a congressman and was next in line for Mayor of this great city (New York), boy how things can change in less than 24 hours.
Weiner still gets my vote, why? Because I vote on politics not morals. I hope NYC see’s pass the bulging shorts and more of his bulging political history.
