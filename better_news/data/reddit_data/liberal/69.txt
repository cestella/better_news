Hillbilly :: Remember This In 2014. Mitch McConnell Voted To Privatize Medicare. Progressive Candidates Needed.
If Mitch McConnell seems vulnerable in 2014 and Kentucky decides to run one of their good ol' boy (Republican lite) Democrats against Mitch McConnell, Mitch McConnell will will win again in 2014 and here's why. To beat Senator Mitch McConnell in 2014 we'll need to make this a national effort and a good ol' boy (Republican lite) Democratic candidate won't cut the mustard nationally, but if Kentucky has a real Democrat to run against Mitch the money will come pouring in from all over the United States to defeat Mitch McConnell and that will weaken the down ticket Republican Congressional candidates like Brett Guthrie KY-2, Ed Whitfield KY-1, Geoff Davis KY-4 and Hal Rogers KY-5.
Some folks believe Governor Steve Beshear is positioning himself to run against Mitch McConnell, in 2014, if he, Steve Beshear, wins the 2011 Gubernatorial election, but Steve Beshear is one of those good ol' boy (Republican lite) Democrats that won't garner much national support and won't help Democratic congressional candidates running against Brett Guthrie KY-2, Ed Whitfield KY-1, Geoff Davis KY-4 and Hal Rogers KY-5 in 2014.
We, progressive Democrats, have the opportunity of a lifetime to send senator Mitch McConnell packing in 2014 and pick up some congressional seats and we need to start working on it now without the help of folks like Julian Carroll, the Kentucky (Republican lite) Democratic Party and their Republican pals.
Note: I'll be voting for Steve Beshear in the 2011 Gubernatorial election. Not because he represents my Democratic values or because he supports the National Democratic Platform but because he's running against, what I consider a right wingnut by the name of David Williams.
