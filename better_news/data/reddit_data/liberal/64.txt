The eXiled is looking to hire two extremely lucky interns this summer. Looking for the sorts of go-getters ‘n’ whippersnappers with web and design skills, research and editing skills, or, heck, absolutely no skills whatsoever. That sound like you? Then fella/missy, your summer-internship problems are over!
If you’re on the market for a quality summer internship, send your resume to jobs@exiledonline.com.
PS: Koch-backed libertarian trolls looking to infiltrate our highly secretive operation, we especially welcome your resumes. It’s been a long time since anyone shined our shoes, and word has it you Kochtards’ve been trained to shine shoes that look like fuckin’ mirrors.
