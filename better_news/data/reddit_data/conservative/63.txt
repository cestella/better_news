A federal judge in Virginia has ruled that the U.S. law banning direct corporate contributions to candidates is unconstitutional, the first such ruling since the Supreme Court’s  2010 decision giving corporations and unions a bigger role in campaign spending.
U.S. District Judge James Cacheris made the ruling Thursday in a case involving federal charges against two men alleged to have made illegal donations to the Senate and presidential campaigns of now-Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton.
