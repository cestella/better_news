Armey wants to draft Ryan for 2012
Former House Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-Texas) said Sunday it's back to square one in the hunt for a likely Republican presidential contender.
"It's certainly a big disappointment," Armey said on CNN's "State of the Union" about Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels' decision not to seek the White House.
"There were a lot of us who were talking to Mitch, trying to get him to take this race on," said Armey, chairman of FreedomWorks and a leader in the national tea party movement.
Daniels notified supporters in an email overnight Saturday that he was opting out of the race, citing family interests. Armey said his grassroots organization is looking for a new prospect.
"We have about 2 million activists across the country and, frankly, we are disappointed," he said. "Now, obviously, we have to start looking, and I was just saying this morning, maybe it's time to start drafting Paul Ryan."
