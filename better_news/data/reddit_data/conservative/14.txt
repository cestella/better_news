As NewsBusters reported Sunday, Time magazine's Joe Klein said on this weekend's "The Chris Matthews Show" Barack Obama has a better relationship with the military than George W. Bush did.
Almost on cue, Gallup released a poll Monday finding military personnel and veterans give Obama lower marks than the rest of the population:
Thirty-seven percent of all active-duty military personnel and veterans surveyed approved of the job Obama is doing during the January 2010 to April 2011 time frame. That compares with 48% of nonveterans interviewed during the same period.
Here's what Klein said this weekend:
"I'd say the relationship is pretty good, very, better than it was with Bush because the military hated the fact that he wasn't really doing the job in Iraq."
Nice call there, Joe.
You do your country - and your magazine! - proud.
