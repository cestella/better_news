Moments after the Iranian president made the startling claim at the    inauguration of a dam in a central province, it started to rain.
"Western countries have designed plans to cause drought in certain areas    of the world, including Iran," Mr Ahmadinejad said in the city of Arak    in Markazi province.
"According to reports on climate, whose accuracy has been verified,    European countries are using special equipment to force clouds to dump"    their water on their continent, he said.
By doing so, "they prevent rain clouds from reaching regional countries,    including Iran," Mr Ahmadinejad charged.
Iran has experienced several droughts in recent years.

Mr Ahmadinejad also recalled an article by "a Western politician,"    whom he did not identify, in which "droughts in some regions spanning    from Turkey and Iran to east of Asia are predicted for the next 30 years."
"The regions (referred to in) the article ... include countries whose    culture and civilisation frighten the West," Mr Ahmadinejad said in    support of his argument.
Iranian leaders claim on a daily basis that Western countries, led by arch-foe    United States, devise "plots" to undermine the Islamic republic    and to impede its economic and scientific development.
They also accuse world powers of colluding against Iran's national unity,    independence, political establishment, culture as well as international    relations.
Mr Ahmadinejad is involved in an unprecedented power    struggle with the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei . He    recently refused to obey orders handed down by Ayatollah Khamenei less than    two years after the pair formed a powerful political alliance to defeat    anti-regime protests that swept the country.
