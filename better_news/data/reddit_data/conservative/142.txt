Dear Bryce,
Nullify Now!
States around the country are considering “nullification” bills on health care mandates, the TSA, federal gun laws, and more in 2011.  To explain the constitutional basis for nullification, the Nullify Now! tour lands in Los Angeles on May 28th! PopModal and the Los Angeles Conservative Alliance are supporting this event and strongly urges you to attend!  Scroll down below this introductory message for tour details.

The 10th Amendment codifies in law that We the People of the several states created the federal government to be our agent for certain enumerated, or listed, powers - and nothing more.
The essential question of our day, though, is this - when the federal government violates these limits,what do we do about it?  Remember the words of Thomas Jefferson who reminds us that the States are, “the most competent administrations for our domestic concerns and the surest bulwarks against antirepublican tendencies.”
So what do we do about it?  Jefferson again gave us the answer.  In 1798 he wrote that "whensoever" the federal government "assumes undelegated powers," that a "nullification of the act is the rightful remedy."
Notice that Jefferson didn't tell us that a nullification of the act is a "good idea" - or that we should first try federal lawsuits or wait for the next election cycle.  He said, in fact, that every time Congress exercises powers not delegated to it - every time - it must be resisted on a state level.  Thus, when states pass laws to reject unconstitutional federal "laws" - this is not rebellion - it's duty.

Through historical writings, case studies, and speeches by the Founding Fathers, Woods will give you a logical, moral, and constitutionally sound case for nullification, revealing:
How we can get rid of Obamacare, TSA Scanners, and other unconstitutional expansions of federal power through nullification
Why the Founding Fathers believed that nullification was the "moderate middle ground.”
Why the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution gives the states the power to nullify unconstitutional laws
Why states - not the Supreme Court - should arbitrate disputes between the states and the federal government over the constitutionality of the federal government's actions.

The Nullification Movement is gaining steam!
The time to act in support of the Constitution is now.  Not next election, and not next year.  Not next month and not next week. Today, not tomorrow. Now.  Please join us at Nullify Now! in Downtown LA on May 28th  - and share this information with all your friends - by email, on facebook, and the like.  Only when good people like yourself work together and do what's right will freedom reign in America.   And for us, doing what's right is pretty straightforward.  We demand adherence to the Constitution.
Get your tickets and stand up for liberty today!
Hope to see you there.
Warmly,
