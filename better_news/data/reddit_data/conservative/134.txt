Obama                                     Courts Hispanics by Addressing Immigration

For President Barack Obama the issue of immigration                                     reform is more about politics than it is about policy.
 
The president has to bring the Latino voter back                                     into the Democratic fold if he hopes to get re-elected in 2012. Hispanics tend to vote for Democrats, but have been doing                                     so in ever fewer numbers in recent elections.
 
Close to seven in 10 Hispanics voted for Democrats                                     in 2006. Obama got two-thirds of the Hispanic vote in 2008. But by 2010, the number was down to 60 percent. Hispanics know                                     that Obama promised that immigration reform would be his first priority. Yet it was not even brought up when Democrats controlled                                     both the House and the Senate by overwhelming numbers in 2009 and 2010.
 
That is why the president was talking about immigration                                     at the border, in El Paso, Texas Tuesday. It was his fourth appeal in as many weeks to Hispanics. It is a political issue                                     the president needs to work for him, and against the Republican Party. So far, it has not been easy.
 
On Tuesday, the president stressed that control of                                     the border had improved considerably since he became president. He said the border was more secure than ever; that the number                                     of undocumented workers apprehended while crossing the border was down while the number of drugs confiscated and weapons-related                                     were up.
 
Republicans immediately refuted the president’s                                     claim that that the U.S. border with Mexico has become more secure since he took office.
 
“President Obama squandered his opportunity                                     for immigration reform within his first two years in office after promising the Latino community it would be his administration                                     priority to pass immigration reform and he expects the nation to believe his immigration policy has changed,” Jesse                                     Hernández, of the Arizona Latino Republican Association, told The Americano.
 
Hernández articulated precisely the argument that                                     Hispanics of both parties have been making about the president’s renewed interest in immigration reform.
 
On Tuesday Obama boasted of increasing border patrol                                     agents, nearing completion of a border fence, and screening more cargo.
 
“We have gone above and beyond what was requested                                     by the very Republicans who said they supported broader reform as long as we got serious about enforcement,” Obama said. “But even though we’ve answered these concerns, I gotta say I suspect there are still going to be some who are                                     trying to move the goal posts on us one more time.”
 
“Maybe they’ll need a moat,” Obama                                     said mockingly to laughter from the crowd. “Maybe they’ll want alligators in the moat.”
 
Republicans replied that the president was not telling                                     the whole story about border security.
 
Rep. Michael McCaul, (R-Texas), said Mexican cartels                                     have increased their presence inside the U.S., the data on spillover crime and violence is “underreported” and                                     that between 70 and 90 percent of Texas’ 1,200-mile border with Mexico is still not under operational control.
 
“Before we start talking about reforming our                                     immigration policy we need to prioritize our national security and gain operational control of the border,” he said                                     in a statement. “Despite the president’s rhetoric that he has gone ‘above and beyond’ to secure the                                     border, this mission is not accomplished.”
 
Rep. Lamar Smith, (R-Texas), chairman of the Judiciary                                     Committee, said, “It is ironic that President Obama would travel so close to the border and still be so far from reality.                                     It is clear President Obama is in full campaign mode, but his words do not match his record. He continues to ignore the facts.”
 
“President Obama once again has failed to show                                     leadership on an issue of importance to Latino community and the security of our nation,” Hernández added.
 
According to Reuters, Obama’s failure to get                                     broader legislation on immigration through Congress has upset many Hispanic voters, especially because the United States deported                                     nearly 400,000 illegal immigrants last year. His critics, including many Democrats say that the Obama administration said                                     it would stress deporting criminals, yet more than half of those deported have not been convicted of any felonies.
 
According to Associated Press, Brendan Buck, spokesman                                     for House Speaker John Boehner, (R-Ohio), said that House Republicans had no plans to take up immigration legislation and                                     argued that if Obama were serious about immigration reform he would have reached out to Boehner on the issue, which Buck said                                     he hasn’t.
 
The issue is clear. Immigration reform legislation                                     will not go anywhere without cooperation from Republicans and having the president use it as a political weapon is not going                                     to make it any easier.
