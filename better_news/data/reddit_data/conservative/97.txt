White House on War Powers Deadline: 'Limited' US Role in Libya Means No Need to Get Congressional Authorization
May 20, 2011  7:14 PM
In an effort to satisfy those arguing he needs to seek congressional authorization to continue US military activity in accordance with the War Powers Resolution, President Obama wrote a letter to congressional leaders this afternoon suggesting that the role is now so “limited” he does not need to seek congressional approval.
“Since April 4,” the president wrote, “U.S. participation has consisted of: (1) non-kinetic support to the NATO-led operation, including intelligence, logistical support, and search and rescue assistance; (2) aircraft that have assisted in the suppression and destruction of air defenses in support of the no-fly zone; and (3) since April 23, precision strikes by unmanned aerial vehicles against a limited set of clearly defined targets in support of the NATO-led coalition's efforts.”
A senior administration official told ABC News that the letter is intended to describe “a narrow US effort that is intermittent and principally an effort to support to support the ongoing NATO-led and UN-authorized civilian support mission and no fly zone.”
“The US role is one of support,” the official said, “and the kinetic pieces of that are intermittent.”
From the beginning of the U.S. military intervention in Libya, the Obama administration has cited the 1973 War Powers Act as the legal basis of its ability to conduct military activities for 60 days without first seeking a declaration of war from Congress. The military intervention started on March 19; Congress was notified on March 21. Those 60 days expire today.
The president thanked the congressional leaders – House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky --- for the support that they have “demonstrated for this mission and for our brave service members, as well as your strong condemnation of the Qaddafi regime.”
The president voiced support for a bipartisan resolution drafted by Senators John Kerry, D-Mass., John McCain, R-Ariz., Carl Levin, D-Mich., Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., Lindsey Graham, R-SC, and Joe Lieberman, I-Conn., stating that Congress “supports the U.S. mission in Libya and that both branches are united in their commitment to supporting the aspirations of the Libyan people for political reform and self-government…Congressional action in support of the mission would underline the U.S. commitment to this remarkable international effort.”
Earlier this month, Kerry – who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee – described his resolution as “in limbo.”

This issue is nothing but a red herring anyway. Obama is not the president of the United States because he has not proven he is eligible to hold that position. He is a criminal usurper who blatantly disregards the rule of law. He is an illegal alien himself, an undocumented worker.

Canadian concerned about what, exactly?
Didn't your nation just hand over power to Harper? Again?
Yeah, good luck with all that. Go on and be concerned, it means so much to us. You're clearly on the cutting edge of the Regressive agenda, with your birther nonsense. Unless I am missing your joke in which case I apologize.
Thanks so much for your "concern." Really.

And soon the Regressives will forget their objections to this issue and they'll foam at the mouth about some other manufactured affront, and it will mean just as much (nothing).
Meanwhile they will stubbornly ignore whatever facts or circumstances that contradict the purported reasons for their naked hatred of the POTUS because they dare not admit the real reasons for their vitriol. "I want my America back!" I bet you do! Nevermind how unfair and horrendous it was, because it wasn't bad for YOU.
I am not surprised that not one of you addressed the issues I raised earlier but instead choose to amplify the regressive, hateful echo-chamber of disingenuous and willfully ignorant accusations, even though they fly in the face of established law. These red-herrings have been clearly and soundly refuted and should be dismissed; but nevermind all that. Your gut feeling trumps all fact or reason.
Someone earlier in this comments thread attributed Trickle-down economics to liberals. WOW. It's typical of the regressive agenda: Accuse the other side of the horrible tactics of your own elected agents, who despise you and work against your own interests; and proclaim it so loudly and so often that it's unassailable truth in your minds.
There are lots of things to be angry about in this broken system, but your "saviors" only want you, the increasingly poor and disenfranchised, to fight against us, the OTHER poor and disenfranchised. This is the real tragedy: that you buy into this paradigm and we fight and hate each other while the uber-rich get uber-richer and the rest of us get leeched, literally, to death.
It's unconscionable. My own beloved brethren betray themselves to the tune of hating the "other" while they give their support and love to those who have no allegiance but to themselves and their corporate sponsors, because they parrot jingoism and spread fear and lies and couch it all in some language in direct opposition to their goals: Take our hard-won rights away and call it Patriotism. Sell our future away in huge tax handouts and giveaways call it "Jobs Now!"
And regressives just blindly follow these evil people and hate their neighbors, laborers, immigrants, "others."
Except we are ALL the others, now. We who own the tiny percentage of our nation's wealth, we who are one paycheck or illness or accident away from financial ruin, we who have been indoctrinated to hate, hate, hate "others" because we "deserve" but they do not.
There's nothing to debate here. This action in Lybia, it's all been laid out in clear language for all to comprehend, but emotion trumps reason and apparently there's just no reasoning with so many.
If your reasoning starts and stops with "If Bush did this" then you already abdicate your obligation to consider the big picture. This world is smaller and smaller every day, and soon enough there will be NO others, except you and me versus the moneyed. They need us to hate and fight each other. And you are all too willing to oblige them.

And how much has it cost for the so called "limited" non-kinetic WAR?
NATO, run by the US, is making the calls. LOL...
And who's E3A are the using...maybe we sold the old A-4 to someone and FRANCE is orchestrating the fighter jet gymnastics, eh?
Go fetch me some real information and stop repeating what the president says.

Ronny V says:
The Constitution gives Congress the authority to declare war, not the president.
Mr. Incredible says:
Congress declares war.  Congress may not make war.  Congress is not the commander-in-chief.  It is not the commander-in-chief's commander-in-chief.
The president, as commander-in-chief, may send his command into combat.  He has the power to make war, not declare it.

The American people, the President and Congress all want a limited role in Lybia. The President was reluctant to even get involved and has authorized only limited force, putting the main responsibility rightly on NATO's shoulders. We do not need to be the world's policeman.
Obama does not want to go to war with Libya, so why should he ask Congress to declare war? Did Congress authorize Bush's war in Iraq that wasted thousands of lives and billions of dollars? The foaming at the mouth against Obama on this board seems disproportionate.
Posted by: Dan Jerrems | May 24, 2011 12:54:00 PM
The White House cannot appropriate the money needed to continue these "limited" functions. Only the Congress can. Obama's arrogance in parsing the War Powers Act pretty much begs Congress to specifically defund all operations related to Libya. No payments to the UN or NATO related to any US actions in Libya.

TO VANCE ARMOR: GIVE SOURCES. I READ THE NEWS FROM DIFFERENT NEWS ALMOST DAILY, I DID NOT FIND SUCH CLAIMS BY PRESIDENT OBAMA ANYWHERE. RATHER, OBAMA EXPLAINED THOSE POWERS ACT GAVE HIM PERMISSION TO ACT ACCORDING TO THE US CONSTITUTION. HIS WORDS MADE SENSE. SEE IN CRITICAL TIMES THERE IS NO TIME TO HESITATE AND DISCUSS NEEDED WAR POWERS ACTIONS IN ORDER TO CARRY URGENT  ACTIONS. ALL PRESIDENTS KNOW THAT.
BESIDES, PRESIDENT OBAMA DID DISCUSS HOW TO DEAL WITH LIBYA, ETC. WITH bOEHNER, PELOSI, AND OTHER CONGRESSIONAL TOP LEADERS.BUT THE SESSIONS WERE CONFIDENTIAL. SO THIS CLAIM ALL CONGRESSPEOPLE DID NOT KNOW IS FALSE, OR A BASIC DYSFUNCTION IN THE CONGRESS. THAT IS NOT PRESIDENT'S OBAMA' FAULT OR RESPONSIBILITY.

That somebody is you, me and everyone else who sees Obama for the Marxist, anti-American, anti-Constitution, anti-capitalist, divisive, racist, ignorant, inexperienced huckster and thug that he is.
Will it be at the ballot box or some other way?
I hope it's the former. But with Obama's complete dismissal of the will of the people and the Constitution, it may
have be by other means.
For example, ex-car czar Ron Bloom said, in October 2009: "We know this is largely about power, that it's an adults only no limit game.
"We kind of agree with Mao that political power comes largely from the barrel of a gun."
Yes, Ron, if you accept what mass-murder Mao Tse-tung believed.
But, you know, that axiom certainly works in all directions regarding dictators and the dictatored.

This was Obama in 2007:  “The President does not have power under the Constitution to unilaterally authorize a military attack in a situation that does not involve stopping an actual or imminent threat to the nation,” Yet Obamma has launche our entire nation into a useless, endless, unauthorized war against a nation that was no threat to the U.S.   And if humanitarianism was the reason what about the murder of thousands by the Assad regime in Syria?  Now Obama tells us he doesn't have to account for his war in any way.  Somebody needs to remind Obama that he is an elected leader not an absolute dictator!
Posted by: valwayne | May 22, 2011 12:24:13 PM
his excuse of limited role doesnt matter. we are attacking libyas conventional ground forces with bombs. we have been in roles where our limited action would mean no congressional permission but this is still to big even though somewhat small scale.

I think Obama is just making this stuff up as he goes along.  And the leftist media allows him to get away with it.
Can anyone imagine a conservative ignoring the War Powers Act so blatantly with the excuse that "this isn't a war, it's a kinetic action in support of our allies" ??  Do you think the media would let a conservative president get away with that?
Of course not.  What a joke.  Congress needs to re-establish it's role as the body that decides whether we go to war, and remind the president that his job is to win the wars that Congress declares.  Plain and simple.
