There is something of a schism in the Republican party and it is because of this woman.Â I do not understand the following this women has established.Â When some of my fellow RepublicansÂ  tell me she is like Ronald Reagan,Â after choking,Â I tell them;Â  “read ‘Reagan’s Diaries’Â andÂ read one of Miss Sarah’s booksÂ simultaneously and see if you feel the same way”Â Â When she speaks, my teeth grind and my ears bleed.
