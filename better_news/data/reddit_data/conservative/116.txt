(AP)Ê TUXTLA GUTIERREZ, Mexico (AP) Ñ Mexican authorities have returned about 400 migrants to their native Guatemala, a day after they and 113 other migrants were found inside two trailer trucks.
Mexican officials say new immigration facilities and inspection points are being built to fight migrant trafficking and provide humane conditions for migrants.
Officials at Mexico's National Immigration Institute say the 113 migrants still being held are from nations that don't share borders with Mexico or are Guatemalan minors or women who require special treatment.
The 400 Guatemalan migrants were returned to their country in air-conditioned buses Wednesday, a stark contrast to the sweltering, overcrowded trailers where they were found.
