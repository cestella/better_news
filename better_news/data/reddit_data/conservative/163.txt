If the Republicans could get a moat filled with aligators along our southern border, the Democrats would be building bridges across it and putting up signs telling the illegal immigrants where to find the bridges. to cross over into the USA illegally.  There is a new book out titled something like this, 'The Lawless Left Liberals', and boy does that tell it all.  Even the mainstream liberal biased media doesn't want the laws of the USA enforced.  Why do the Democrats even legislate laws, if they're going to let them be ignored or violated, without consequence, whenever it pleases them?

instead of alligators try snakes.Or maybe lions, tigers and bears.  Come on now, I think the Pres is being a bit childlike.  Doesn't he know that we have figured him out.  He wants the illigals to vote for him.  My question is?  How can an illigal immigrate vote, legally that is?  We should round up all the illigals, promise them anything and then lock them up until the election is over. If this guy gets votes this time, I may just start a war of my own.  I love my counry, I will not give up on it, I will forever fight for it.  Just look at what we have done with our freedoms in this wonderful country.  we need to all stand and make it known how much we love our country and will not let anyone destroy what we have worked so hard to accomplish.  There is no other country like this one in the whole world  All the other countries want what we have, but cannot have it because they do not allow the freedoms that we have here.  Think long and hard about it.  Please really think hard about your vote for the next election year.  Do you want this country to stay the way it has been or do you want to lose it.  I guarantee, keeping it the way it should be, will be super hard to do if Obama is president for a second term.  Also, we need someone strong to kick his butt out of the running.  We all need to put our heads together and find a really good strong person to run against him.  Someone who will show this country how to remain strong and free.  Come on now, there has to be someone out there.  Please! Let us pray for a good person to run against Obama and stop the distruction of this country.I also would like to know who in this country is hiring the illigals.  They should be shipped out, also.  All employers need to stop hiring illigals NOW.  Then they will stop coming to this country.  The only reason they keep coming over here is because they know who will hire them.  If there were no jobs for them, they would stop coming.  Who gives them money, anyway.  Are they crazy or something.

INSTEAD OF KILLING BIN LADEN, THEY SHOULD'VE KILLED THIS IGNORANT MORON. WHAT A DISGRACE HE IS, AS HE SLOWLY BUT SURELY TRIES TO FLUSH THE UNITED STATES DOWN THE TOILET. THE CITIZENS OF THE UNITED STATES HAVE GOT TO STOP THIS GUY.....WHO CALLS HIMSELF PRESIDENT. OBAMA & HIS CREW OF IGNORANT DEMOCRATS COULDN'T MANAGE A WHORE HOUSE & THEY'RE TRYING TO MANAGE THE GREATEST COUNTRY ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH. WHAT A DAMN DISGRACE HE IS. WHEN HE WAS RUNNING FOR OFFICE, THE MEDIA REFERRED TO HIS FOLLOWERS AS YOUNG IDEALISTS. THESE IDIOTS WOULDN'T KNOW AN IDEA IF IT JUMPED UP & BIT THEM ON THE ASS.

What we need to do is use our Constitutional rights and have  the guts to do whst all real law abiding citizens who support the Constitution and the laws of this land. Un like those assholes with the big letter D after there title!

Lets face it, the illegal's won't want his dream act if it means paying a fine and then pay taxes and learn english. They have it better than that right now. Yes, better than us USA citizens. The prez is good at one thing though, that is dividing this country with his racism.

Illegals should be immediately arrested & deported when they apply for benefits here. I guess that's too easy...
