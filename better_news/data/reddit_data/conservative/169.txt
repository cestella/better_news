Top of the Ticket: Half of Republicans polled still don't believe Obama was born in USA
Early in Obama's appearance, someone shouted out, “Thank you for getting Bin Laden!’’
Obama said that was a “case in point’’ – a reason for voters to let him “finish what we started.’’

Later, Obama ticked off what he described as his administration’s accomplishments: lifting the ban on gays in the military; bringing troops home from Iraq.
And then: “And because of the extraordinary bravery of the men and women who wear this nation’s uniform and the outstanding work of our intelligence agencies,’’ Obama said, “Osama bin Laden will never again threaten the United States.’’
The crowd roared.
While the president has basked in the success of the operation, Bin Laden's sons released a statement Tuesday criticizing the administration, saying the U.S. broke international law in killing an unarmed man.
In Washington, Vice President Biden, coming off another round of deficit talks, was asked by reporters whether Bin Laden's killing at the hands of the U.S. military was illegal.
"Are you kidding?" Biden replied.
