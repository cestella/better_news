Weiner starting to sweat
Anthony Weiner (aka Horshack) is starting to act more and more like the cat that swallowed the canary. Weiner is becoming so unglued by the “weinergate” scandal that began over the weekend that he’s fighting with MSM reporters – including his cheerleaders over at CNN.
Check out this video posted on Mediaite and decide for yourself if Weiner is acting like an innocent victim of a vile right-wing hacker. If you decide to watch the entire nauseating video, notice how Weiner goes directly to the Saul Alinsky playbook and starts in with the typical class warfare rhetoric.
I never thought I’d see the day when Dana Bash actually conducted herself as a real journalist. And the guy standing next to Ms. Bash; he gets my vote for Reporter of the Year!
What’s really telling for me is right at the beginning when Horsh…I mean Weiner describes the incident as a “Prank.”  This tells me that little ole’ pencil-neck has begun to subtly change the narrative. When it becomes impossible for Weiner and his people to deny that he sent the tweet, he’ll then come clean and chalk it up as an inappropriate yet innocent “prank” he pulled on Ms. Cordova and all his other 45,000 followers. Although Weiner probably goofed by making the tweet public, it will wind up working in his favor. He’ll indignantly claim that his making the tweet public only proves that he and Ms. Cordova were not involved in any hanky-panky and that it was just an unfortunate parody of the many jokes that are associated with his name – that’s all!
By the way Mr. Weiner, it was very classy of you calling the reporter a “jackass” for just doing his job. I wonder if you would have called him that if he were a black reporter.
