The rise of the therapeutic state has recently become a subject of study for scholars who have attempted to clarify how what Philip Rieff originally called â€œthe triumph of the therapeuticâ€? has altered not only the normative structure but also the institutional structure of the state in advanced postindustrial societies. Most social commentators emphasize that the rise of a therapeutic worldview, grounded in psychological approaches to private and public life, redefined the understanding and conduct of political life during the last half of the twentieth century. For conservatives concerned with the growth and power of the state, the implications of therapeutic culture are especially important because the justifications and uses of state power have increasingly become therapeuticâ€”the treatment or melioration of pathologies and assurance of citizensâ€™ sense of well-beingâ€”rather than the protection of rights and liberties or the provision of support for conventional moral constraints and democratic conceptions of citizenship.
The groundwork for the rise of the therapeutic state was probably laid in the United States during the Progressive Era and later expanded during the New Deal with the rise of a federal welfare state, which saw the expansion of human services under policies such as the Social Security Act. Although some scholars tend to equate the welfare state with the therapeutic state, a good case can be made for the rise of therapeutic states in Western Europe and the United States during the postâ€“World War II era, insofar as conventional ideals of moral responsibility have gradually become subordinate to therapeutic ideals. Under what JÃ?rgen Habermas has called a â€œtherapeutocracy,â€? the state has intervened in and challenged the autonomy of civil society, with the consequence that professional expertise, rather than financial aid, has become the more significant mode of state intervention.
During World War II, the role of psychological experts in the United States dramatically increased as such experts obtained a variety of policy positions charged with duties ranging from waging psychological warfare to protecting the mental health of military personnel. After 1945, the influence of psychological expertise in public policy continued to grow in the field of national security, by means of the Veterans Administration, and in new directions on the domestic front as symbolized by the passage of the National Mental Health Act of 1946, which supported research, professional training, and grants to states for mental health facilities. Generally, the political fortunes of psychology improved in the postwar decades with every state accepting the licensing of psychologists from 1946 to 1977, and most states recognizing psychologists as expert witnesses during the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s.
The 1960s were a watershed for the growth of the therapeutic state, with the advance of the Great Society and such developments as the expansion of the definition of emotional injury in personal injury law and the rise of the â€œvalues clarificationâ€? movement in public education.
But the 1990s may have signaled a broader acceptance of therapeutic assumptions. Values clarification, for example, preceded the more successful â€œself-esteemâ€? movement that gained widespread acceptance in education even among some conservatives by the 1990s. Similarly, therapeutic approaches to criminal justiceâ€”pioneered under the 1972 federal program known as Treatment Alternatives to Street Crimeâ€”expanded during the 1990s with such efforts as the popular Drug Court Movement. In short, by the end of the twentieth century the therapeutic state appeared to be well-enough established that opposition to the welfare state did not necessarily translate into a rejection of therapeutic efforts to reform the very definition of welfare itself.
