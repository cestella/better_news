Reagan was a politician that we needed in the 80's.  I suspect that if Reagan was alive today he would encourage different agendas that he did as a president in the middle of the cold war.  Reagan was proud to be an US Citizen and honored to have been chosen to lead our country.  He took that mantle not as a right, or as a way to further his agenda as a catholic.  He defeated socialism by making it compete with capitolism.
It is one of the great failings of both the right and the left that they believe the rest of the world will decend into chaos if we are not there to meddle with it.
As for would Reagan back Ron Paul... If he won the primary yes he would.  He would never be seen on tv, radio, or in print attacking any of the republican hopefuls.  That is because he had a class that has been lost in the age of the internet troll.
